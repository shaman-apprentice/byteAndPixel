[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/shaman-apprentice/byteAndPixel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/shaman-apprentice/byteAndPixel)

## How to run locally:

- install [nodejs LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- run `npm i` in your terminal
- run `npm run dev`, which starts the bundling of your JavaScript into _dist_, and watches for changes continuously

Note that _hardware acceleration_ must be turned on (default setting) in your browser, and that _index.html_ must be served by a server for local dev.
